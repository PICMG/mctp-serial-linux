IoTorch is a series of libraries for embedded microcontroller platforms that implement robust industrial communications protocols over serial interfaces using the Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP), and Platform Level Data Model (PLDM) both from the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF).  Copies of these specifications may be freely downloaded from the DMTF here:
- [MCTP Specification](https://www.dmtf.org/documents/pmci/management-component-transport-protocol-mctp-base-specification-131)
- [MCTP Serial Transport Binding Specification](https://www.dmtf.org/documents/pmci/mctp-serial-transport-binding-specification-100)
- [PLDM Specification](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0240_1.2.0.pdf)

Together, these two specifications provide lightweight, robust transport and application-layer data communications suitable for small-scale embedded devices.

The first goals of this project, by phase are:
- **Phase 1** 
    - Implement Linux-based test environment for valiation of MCTP, leveraging existing Linux support.
    - Implement MCTP communications support for Arduino devices with testing on Uno, and NanoEvery platforms.
    - Develop release process for MCTP library code
- **Phase 2**
    - Implement PLDM server code for Uno and NanoEvery that communicates on top of MCTP protocol
    - Implement Linux client and validation strategy for PLDM endpoints.
    -- Develop release process for PLDM library code
- **Phase 3**
    -- Implement MCTP and PLDM for additional tbd processor architecture

## Repository Resources
* Linux-mctp: Resources for linux userpsace development.  The README for this portion of the project.
    * [README](./README.md) - the detailed readme for linux installation for these tools.
    * *lib-mctp* - a lightweight c++ library for mctp-over serial support.  It includes ojbects for framing and bridging.
    * *mctp-bridge* - a userspace tool for instantiating a serial-backed mctp endpoint that supports broadcast messaging and remains persistent even if the underlying serial device is removed. More information on this tool can be found in its associated [README](./linux-mctp/mctp-bridge/README.md)
    * *patches* - kernel patches that may be required on some systems.  See [PATCHING_THE_KERNEL](./linux-mctp/patches/PATCHING_THE_KERNEL.md) for more information.
